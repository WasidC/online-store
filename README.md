# Online Store (CLI Application)

## Description of the Project

This project is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) Online Store Application built in Java.  
It allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout all through a text-based interface.

## User Stories

- As a customer, I want to view all available products so that I can see what the store offers.
- As a customer, I want to add products to my cart so that I can purchase them later.
- As a customer, I want to view my cart so that I can see the total cost before checkout.
- As a customer, I want to remove or adjust items in my cart so that I can modify my purchase easily.
- As a customer, I want to check out and pay for my items so that I can complete my order.
- As a user, I want clear feedback and instructions so that I know how to navigate the store interface.
- As a developer, I want to write modular, reusable code so that the application can be easily extended later.

- Add a receipt generator that saves checkout details to a text file in a Receipts folder.
- Include remove item functionality from the cart.
- Improve error handling and input validation during checkout.
- Add search filtering by product name or department.
